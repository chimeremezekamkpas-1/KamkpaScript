💻 KamkpaScript (.ks)

The Future of Human-Readable Programming.
Built for simplicity, readability, and versatility — from web pages to search engine, crawlers, and beyond.


---

🌍 Overview

KamkpaScript is a custom-designed, human-readable scripting language created by Chimeremeze Kamkpas for personal and project-based development.
It is designed to be expressive, minimal, and modular — allowing creators to build projects with intuitive syntax such as:

p.type = 'web page'  
title = 'Day in a Life'  
background-color = 'blue'  
header-text = 'Welcome to KamkpaScript'  
paragraph = 'This is my first KamkpaScript project.'  
footer-text = '© 2025 KamkpaScript'

KamkpaScript makes use of a protocol called, p.type, which means Project Type, to identify the project being programmed.

🧠 What Makes KamkpaScript Unique

Human-Readable Syntax: Natural English-like scripting with no complex symbols.

Multi-Logic Support: Create web pages, AI logic, chatbots, web scrapers, crawlers, games, and search engines.

Runs Directly in Browser: No compiler installation — runs via the KamkpaScript Interpreter (HTML/JS).

Lightweight and Modular: Simple to extend with new logic modules.

File-Based Projects: Save and load .ks files for full project sessions.
